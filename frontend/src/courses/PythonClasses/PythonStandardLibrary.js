      <h3>The Python Standard Library</h3>
      <p>
        The Python standard library comprises a collection of modules that come
        pre-installed with every Python distribution. After gaining a
        fundamental understanding of classes, we can leverage these modules,
        which have been developed by other programmers. By including a
        straightforward import statement at the beginning of our Python files,
        we gain access to any function or class within the standard library. As
        an example, let's explore the class OrderedDict from the collection’s
        module. This class provides a specialized dictionary data structure in
        Python that preserves the order of inserted elements, unlike the
        standard dict class. By importing and utilizing classes like OrderedDict
        from the standard library, we can enhance our Python programs with
        additional functionality and efficiency without needing to write code
        from scratch.
        <br />
        Dictionaries in Python are powerful for associating pieces of
        information, but by default, they do not preserve the order in which
        key-value pairs are added. However, in situations where maintaining the
        insertion order of key-value pairs is crucial, we can utilize the
        OrderedDict class from the collections module. Instances of the
        OrderedDict class function similarly to regular dictionaries, with the
        key distinction that they retain the order in which key-value pairs are
        inserted. This feature is particularly useful when we need to process
        items in the dictionary in the order they were added or maintain a
        specific sequence of elements. By using the OrderedDict class, we can
        ensure predictable and consistent behavior in scenarios where preserving
        the order of elements is essential.
        <br />
        Let’s look at an Python code example:
        <br />(
        <div
          className="code-background"
          style={{ backgroundColor: "#a4f4e4", padding: "20px" }}
        >
          <div
            className="code-container"
            style={{ backgroundColor: "#ffffff", padding: "20px" }}
          >
            <pre>
              <code>
                {`from collections import OrderedDict<br/>
<br/>
favorite_languages = OrderedDict()<br/>
<br/>
favorite_languages['Jen'] = 'Python'<br/>
favorite_languages['Rohit'] = 'Python'<br/>
favorite_languages['Mohit'] = 'C'<br/>
favorite_languages['Edward'] = 'Ruby'<br/>
<br/>
for name, language in favorite_languages.items():<br/>
    print(name + "'s favorite language is " + language + ".")`}
              </code>
            </pre>
          </div>
        </div>
        <br />
        We start by importing the OrderedDict class from the collections module.
        Then, we create an instance of the OrderedDict class and assign it to
        the variable favorite_languages. Notably, there are no curly brackets as
        seen in regular dictionaries. Instead, the call to OrderedDict()
        generates an empty ordered dictionary, which we store in
        favorite_languages. Subsequently, we add each name and corresponding
        language to favorite_languages one by one, from lines three to six. By
        employing this ordered dictionary, when we iterate through
        favorite_languages using a for loop, we can reliably expect to retrieve
        responses in the exact order they were inserted. This ensures that the
        order of key-value pairs is preserved, allowing for predictable and
        consistent retrieval of data.
        <br />
        Here is the output of the code:
        <br />
        Jen's favorite language is Python.
        <br />
        Rohit's favorite language is Python.
        <br />
        Mohit's favorite language is C.
        <br />
        Edward's favorite language is Ruby.
        <br />
        Indeed, the OrderedDict class from the collections module is a valuable
        tool to be aware of in Python programming. It effectively combines the
        primary advantages of lists, such as preserving the original order of
        elements, with the key feature of dictionaries, which allows us to
        associate pieces of information. As we delve into modeling real-world
        scenarios that are important to us, we are likely to encounter
        situations where an ordered dictionary precisely meets our requirements.
        With OrderedDict, we can maintain the sequence of items while still
        enjoying the flexibility of dictionary-like behavior. As we continue to
        explore the Python standard library, we will discover numerous modules
        like collections that provide solutions for handling common programming
        tasks, empowering us to write more efficient and robust code.
        <b>Summary</b>
        <br />
        We looked at the foundations of creating our own Python classes in this
        chapter. We learned how to build methods to give our classes certain
        behaviors and how to use attributes to encapsulate data within a class.
        We discovered how to initialize instances of our classes with
        predetermined attributes by putting the __init__() method into practice.
        Additionally, we learned how to change characteristics both directly and
        through methods, which allowed us to interact with instances
        dynamically. We discovered that by inheriting properties and methods
        from parent classes, we can expedite the creation of related classes
        through the concept of inheritance. We also looked at the idea of
        composition, which encourages modularity and simplicity by using
        instances of one class as characteristics of another.
        <br />
        We also learned about the organizational advantages of keeping classes
        in modules and importing them into pertinent files as needed, which
        promotes maintainability and structure in projects. We also looked into
        the Python standard library and found an example in the OrderedDict
        class from the collection’s module. This course demonstrated how to use
        pre-existing modules to solve common programming problems by offering
        solutions that combine the advantages of dictionaries and lists.
        <br />
        All things considered, this chapter gave us the fundamental information
        and useful abilities we needed to efficiently design and implement
        Python classes, promoting modularity, organization, and code reuse in
        our projects. Building reliable and scalable software solutions is made
        easier when we have a deeper understanding of classes and modules.
