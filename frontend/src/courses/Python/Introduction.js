                When I started coding the first language, I learned for coding was “C”. It is a great language but at the same time, it is quite difficult for beginners and also till now I think I am not able to understand it properly. It is a very fast and old language which makes it very important especially for tasks where we need fast executions. But now to learn to code now we have many languages which are I think much easier to understand and write as compared to C or any other old programming language (here I mention I have no offense to those languages I only say that if you are not able to understand them then you must start with new more modern coding languages). Python is one such language that is easy to learn, write, and understand. Therefore, in this book, we shall learn about Python, its properties, libraries, functions, etc.

                We know that software is the core of the most of electronic tools we use in today's world. Almost everyone has any type of social media account through which they communicate, have internet connection in their phones, laptops, and PCs, and also most of the jobs include interaction with some sort of electronic device to do their work. It leads to the demand for coders to high.

                        <p>
                            <b>Clear and Simple Syntax :-</b> Python’s syntax is straightforward and resembles the English language, making it easy for developers to read, write, and understand code. This simplicity contributes to faster development and easier maintenance, especially for beginners who find Python more accessible compared to language with complex syntax.
                        </p>

                    <li>
                        <p>
                            <b>Conciseness and Readability :-</b> Python’s syntax allows developers to express concepts in fewer lines of code compared to some other programming languages. The emphasis on readability is encapsulated in the Zen of Python, a set of aphorisms that highlight the importance of clear and readable code.
                        </p>

                    <li>
                        <p>
                            <b>Interpreted Language and Rapid Prototyping :-</b> Python operates on an interpreter system, enabling code to be executed as soon as it is written. This characteristic facilitates rapid prototyping, allowing the developer to quickly test and iterate their ideas. The ability to run code interactively promotes a more dynamic and agile development process.
                        </p>

                <h3 className="subHead">Python Syntax compared to other programming languages</h3>
                <p>
                Let’s look at the distinctive aspects of Python syntax in more detail compared to other programming languages.
                </p>
                <ol style={{listStyleType:'decimal'}}>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            <b>Readability and English-like Syntax :-</b> One of Python’s key design principles is readability. The syntax is intentionally designed to be clear and readable, with an emphasis on reducing the use of symbols and special characters. This readability is enhanced by a syntax that resembles the English language, making it more accessible to developers. This design choice contributes to Python’s ease of learning and understanding.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            <b>New Lines as Command Delimiters :-</b> In Python, new lines are used to complete a command or statement. This is in contrast to many other programming languages that often use semicolons or parentheses to separate commands on the same line. The absence of explicit line-ending characters like semicolons contributes to the clean and uncluttered appearance of Python code.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            <b>Indentation for Scope definition :-</b> Python utilizes indentation, or whitespace, to define the scope of various constructs, such as loops, functions, and classes. The level of indentation determines the block or score of code. This is a departure from many other programming languages that typically use curly braces ({}) to delineate blocks of code. Python’s use of indentation enforces a consistent and visually intuitive code structure.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            <b>Influence from mathematics :-</b> Python’s syntax is influenced by mathematical notation, particularly in its use of colons and indentation to signify code blocks. This influence provides a clear and natural structure to Python code, aligning with the principles of readability and simplicity. 
                        </p>
                    </li>

                        <p>
                            <b>Minimal use of symbols :-</b> Python tends to minimize the use of symbols and special characters in its syntax. This is in contrast to some other programming languages that may rely more heavily on symbols for various operations. The reduced dependence on symbols contributes to a cleaner and less cluttered appearance, aligning with the Pythonic emphasis on simplicity.
                        </p>

                <p>
                    Python programming language comes with a preinstall interpreter that runs on the terminal window. It allows us to try bits of Python without saving the code and run the entire program. There is a belief in the programming community that printing Hello World! Message to the screen of our first program in any programming language will bring us luck in learning and advancing it. So, let’s write Hello World! Program in Python.
                </p>
                <p><span className="pycode">print</span>("Hello World!")</p>
                <p>
                    As we can see in the above code to print the Hello World! In Python, we just need to write one line of code. We write this simple code as a first program in any programming language has a purpose it checks whether the program that we write is working well or not. If this program runs properly then any program which we write is correct will run in our system.
