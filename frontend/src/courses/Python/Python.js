        When I started coding the first language, I learned for coding was “C”.
        It is a great language but at the same time, it is quite difficult for
        beginners and also till now I think I am not able to understand it
        properly. It is a very fast and old language which makes it very
        important especially for tasks where we need fast executions. But now to
        learn to code now we have many languages which are I think much easier
        to understand and write as compared to C or any other old programming
        language (here I mention I have no offense to those languages I only say
        that if you are not able to understand them then you must start with new
        more modern coding languages). Python is one such language that is easy
        to learn, write, and understand. Therefore, in this book, we shall learn
        about Python, its properties, libraries, functions, etc.

        We know that software is the core of the most of electronic tools we use
        in today's world. Almost everyone has any type of social media account
        through which they communicate, have internet connection in their
        phones, laptops, and PCs, and also most of the jobs include interaction
        with some sort of electronic device to do their work. It leads to the
        demand for coders to high.

        This set of blogs is for everyone who want to learn Python or even who
        is an expert in Python or coding and tries to sharpen his/her coding
        ability or understand Python in more depth. These blogs aim to take the
        reader up to speed with Python so they can learn as quickly as possible.
