      <h4>What is C++</h4>
      <br />
      <p>
        C++ is a general-purpose object-oriented programming language. It was
        created by Bjarne Stroustrup at Bell Labs around 1980. C++ is very
        similar to C (invented by Dennis Ritchie in the early 1970s). C++ is so
        compatible with C that it will probably compile more than 99% of C
        programs without changing a line of source code. Although C++ is an
        OOP-based language, it is much better structured and safer than C.
        <br />
        Some computer languages are written for a specific purpose. Because Java
        was originally designed to control toasters and other electronics. C was
        developed for operating system programming. Pascal's idea was to teach
        proper programming techniques. But C++ is a general-purpose language. It
        very well deserves the widely recognized nickname "Swiss Army Knife of
        Languages".

        This new programming language was called C with Classes but was later
        renamed C++ (++ refers to the C concatenation operator).
        <br />
        A few more upgrades or versions of C++ is being exist:
        <br />- C++98, C++03, C++11(C++ox), C++14(C++1y), C++17(C++1z)
