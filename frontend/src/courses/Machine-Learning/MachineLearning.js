        When we think about machine learning we many times think of situations
        like those described in The Terminator movie in which machine starts to
        think on their own like humans and start a war against humanity, but
        things like this are still far away from reality because till now
        machines can only do one task at a time with precision even when they
        are trained on similar data or situation for long time or with many
        data. Therefore, when we think about machine learning we think that
        machines can think or be able to learn by themselves which is not fully
        true. Machine learning is a subfield of artificial intelligence we can
        say that artificial is a superset then machine learning is only a part
        or subset of machine learning but we often discuss them together. It
        allows the systems or computers to automatically learn from already
        available data. To do this machine learning uses various algorithms and
        mathematical formulas. In this, we will look at what is machine learning
        and its types and learn about them.
