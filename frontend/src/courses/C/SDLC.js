      <p>
        Software development life cycle (SDLC) is a process that describes how
        software is built, maintained, replaced, and improved over time. SDLC is
        a roadmap that outlines how software is developed, maintained, and
        enhanced over time. It defines a way to improve the quality of the
        software and the overall development process.
        <br />
        What are the stages of the software development life cycle?
        <br />
        Software development life cycles (SDLCs) define the tasks to be
        completed at different stages by software engineers or developers. SDLCs
        ensure that the final product meets the customer's expectations and is
        within the company's budget. Therefore, a software engineer needs to
        have a good understanding of the software development process. There are
        a total of 7 phases of the software development cycle as planning,
        analysis, design, development, testing, software development and
        maintenance.
        <br />
        Let us understand in a brief way. We Think App is a Software and Mobile
        app improvement employer that follows the Software Development Life
        Cycle (SDLC) to ensure the successful shipping of amazing cellular apps.
        We Think App follows the great practices of SDLC to make sure that every
        level of the improvement technique is cautiously planned, executed, and
        monitored.
        <br />
        The following are a number of the Best SDLC tiers to follow:
        <br />
        Stage-1: Planning and Requirement <br />
        Analysis Planning is an important step in everything, simply as in
        software program development. In this identical stage, requirement
        evaluation is likewise achieved with the aid of using the builders of
        the organization. This is attained from consumer inputs, and income
        department/marketplace surveys. The data from this evaluation paperwork
        the constructing blocks of a fundamental venture. The exceptional of the
        venture is the end result of planning. Thus, at this stage, the
        fundamental venture is designed with all of the to-be-had data. <br />
        Stage 2: Defining Requirements In this stage, all the requirements for
        the target software are specified. These requirements get approval from
        customers, market analysts, and stakeholders. This is fulfilled by
        utilizing SRS (Software Requirement Specification). This is a sort of
        document that specifies all those things that need to be defined and
        created during the entire project cycle.
        <br />
        Stage 3: Designing
        <br />
        In the planning stage, a detailed plan is prepared by the software. In
        this phase, the software team designs the software architecture,
        modules, interfaces, and data structures. They also create wireframes
        and mock-ups that illustrate how the software looks and works. The
        design phase is critical because it provides developers with a roadmap
        for building the software and ensures that the software is scalable,
        maintainable, and meets customer requirements.
        <br />
        Stage 4: Development stage
        <br />
        The development stage involves coding the software based on the design
        specifications created in the previous stage. During this stage,
        developers use programming languages, development tools, and software
        frameworks to build the software. They also conduct unit testing to
        ensure that each module or component functions correctly. The
        development stage is critical as it brings the software to life and
        ensures that it is of high quality.
        <br />
        Stage 5: Product testing and integration <br />
        After product development, software testing is necessary to ensure its
        smooth operation. However, minimal testing is done at each stage of the
        SDLC. Therefore, at this stage, all possible failures are observed,
        corrected and retested. This ensures that the product meets SRS quality
        requirements. Documentation, Training and Support: Software
        documentation is an integral part of the software development life
        cycle. A well-written document is a tool and vehicle for the repository
        of knowledge necessary to understand software processes, operations, and
        maintenance. The documentation also contains information on how to use
        the product. The purpose of training is to improve an employee's current
        or future performance by increasing the employee's effectiveness through
        learning, usually by changing attitudes and developing skills and
        understanding.
        <br />
        Stage 6: Deployment and maintenance of products
        <br />
        After detailed testing, the final product is released in phases
        according to the organization's strategy. It is then tested in a real
        industrial environment. It is important to ensure its smooth operation.
        If it works well, the organization ships the product as a whole. After
        getting useful feedback, the company releases it as is or with further
        improvements to make it even more useful to customers. But that alone is
        not enough. Therefore, in addition to commissioning, product monitoring
        is also carried out.

      <h3 className="subHead">SDLC life cycle models</h3>
      <p>
        The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a mental model used in
        project management that defines the stages of an information system
        development project from an initial feasibility study to maintenance of
        the finished application. There are different software definitions and
        design models followed in the software development phase. These models
        are also called "software development process models." Each process
        model follows a unique sequence of steps to ensure success in the
        software development phase.
        <br />
        1) Waterfall model
        <br />
        It is the basic model of the software development life cycle. This is a
        very simple model. The waterfall model is no longer used in practice,
        but it is the basis for all other SDLC models. Due to its simple
        structure, the waterfall model is easier to use and gives a concrete
        result. With the waterfall model, this cannot be changed once the step
        appears to be complete, and due to its less flexible nature, the
        waterfall model is no longer practical.
        <br />
        2) Agile model
        <br />
        Agile methodology is a practice that encourages continuous interaction
        between development and testing throughout the SDLC process of any
        project. In the Agile method, the entire project is divided into small
        incremental structures. Each of these versions is delivered in
        iterations, with each iteration lasting between one and three weeks.
        <br />
        Each phase of agile software development is characterized in a way that
        meets several basic assumptions about the vast majority of software
        projects: It is difficult to predict which software requirements will
        remain and which will change. It is equally difficult to predict how
        user priority will change as the project progresses.
        <br />
        Many types of software design and development are intertwined. In other
        words, both activities should be done in parallel to demonstrate the
        design patterns in their creation. It's hard to imagine how much
        planning is required before testing a configuration with a build.
        Analysis, design, development and testing are not as predictable (from a
        project perspective) as we would like.
        <br />
        3) Iterative model
        <br />
        It is a particular implementation of a software development life cycle
        that focuses on an initial, simplified implementation, which then
        progressively gains more complexity and a broader feature set until the
        final system is complete. In short, iterative development is a way of
        breaking down the software development of a large application into
        smaller pieces.
        <br />
        4) Spiral model
        <br />
        The spiral model is a risk-driven process model. This SDLC model helps
        the group to adopt elements of one or more process models like a
        waterfall, incremental, waterfall, etc. The spiral technique is a
        combination of rapid prototyping and concurrency in design and
        development activities. Each cycle in the spiral begins with the
        identification of objectives for that cycle, the different alternatives
        that are possible for achieving the goals, and the constraints that
        exist. This is the first quadrant of the cycle (upper-left quadrant).
        The next step in the cycle is to evaluate these different alternatives
        based on the objectives and constraints. The focus of evaluation in this
        step is based on the risk perception for the project. The next step is
        to develop strategies that solve uncertainties and risks. This step may
        involve activities such as benchmarking, simulation, and prototyping.
        <br />
        5) V-shaped model <br />
        The V-shaped model is executed sequentially in V-shape. Each stage or
        phase of this model is integrated with a testing phase. After every
        development phase, a testing phase is associated with it, and the next
        phase will start once the previous phase is completed, i.e., development
        and testing. It is also known as the verification or validation model
        <br />
        6) Big bang model <br />
        The Big Bang model focuses all resources on software development and
        coding with little or no planning. Requirements are understood and met
        as they come. This model works best for small projects with a smaller
        development team working together. It is also useful for academic
        software development projects. This is an ideal template where
        requirements are unknown or no final release date is given.
        <br />
        7) RAD model
        <br />
        RAD or Rapid Application Development process is an adoption of the
        waterfall model; it targets developing software in a short period. The
        RAD model is based on the concept that a better system can be developed
        in less time by using focus groups to gather system requirements.
        <br />
        o Business modeling
        <br />
        o Data modeling
        <br />
        o Process Modeling
        <br />
        o Application Generation
        <br />
        o Testing and Turnover
        <br />
        8) Incremental model <br />
        The incremental model is not separate. It is necessarily a series of
        waterfall cycles. The requirements are divided into groups at the start
        of the project. For each group, the SDLC model is followed to develop
        software. The SDLC process is repeated, with each release adding more
        functionality until all requirements are met. In this method, each cycle
        acts as the maintenance phase for the previous software release.
        Modification to the incremental model allows development cycles to
        overlap. After that subsequent cycle may begin before the previous cycle
        is complete.
        <br />
        9) Iterative model
        <br />
        It is a particular implementation of a software development life cycle
        that focuses on an initial, simplified implementation, which then
        progressively gains more complexity and a broader feature set until the
        final system is complete. In short, iterative development is a way of
        breaking down the software development of a large application into
        smaller pieces.
