        <h3 className="subHead">Introduction to pointers in C</h3>
        <p>
          As we mentioned earlier, a pointer in C is a variable that holds a
          memory address. Pointers can be used to manipulate the memory of a
          variable and the value stored in it. Pointers are one of the most
          obvious and exciting features of the C language. It gives strength and
          flexibility to the tongue. Although the tips may seem confusing and
          complicated at first, trust me, once you understand the concept, you
          can do a lot more in C. When a variable is defined in a program, the
          system allocates a memory location or address for that variable that
          holds the defined value. This place has its address number, which we
          saw in the program above.
        </p>
        <p>
          Assume that the system has a reserved memory location 80F for variable
          a.
          <br />
          Int n=10
          <br />
          Int p=&n
          <br />

      </div>

      <div>
        <p>
          Declaring a pointer
          <br />
          In C, a pointer can be declared using the * (letter symbol). Also
          known as an indirect pointer, it is used to dereference a pointer.
        </p>
        <ol style={{ listStyleType: "decimal" }}>
          <li>
            <p>int *a; //pointer to int</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>char *c; //pointer to char</p>
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          By the help of * (indirection operator), we can print the value of
          pointer variable p.
        </p>
        <p>Let's see the pointer example as explained for the above figure.</p>

        <p>In C, there are two types of pointer operators :-</p>
        <ol style={{ listStyleType: "disc" }}>
          <li>
            <p>operator</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>&operator</p>
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          Operators in C have been examined in detail in distinct sections. The
          operand's memory address is returned by the & operator. As an
          illustration, a = &b; The memory address of variable b will be saved
          in variable a. The counterpart of & is the * operator. The value found
          at the specified location is returned by this operator. For instance,
          if the variable b's memory location is included in a, then the code, c
          is equal to *a; will cause the variable b's value to be stored in c.

          How to read the pointer: int (*p)[10].
          <br />
          To read the pointer, we must see that () and [] have the equal
          precedence. Therefore, their associativity must be considered here.
          The associativity is left to right, so the priority goes to (). Inside
          the bracket (), pointer operator * and pointer name (identifier) p
          have the same precedence. Therefore, their associativity must be
          considered here which is right to left, so the priority goes to p, and
          the second priority goes to *. Assign the 3rd priority to [] since the
          data type has the last precedence. Therefore the pointer will look
          like following.
