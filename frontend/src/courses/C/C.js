      <h3>Introduction</h3>
      <p>
        First, it is a general-purpose structural and procedural programming
        language developed in 1972 by Dennis Ritchie at the Bell Labs.
        <br />
        It is called the fundamental of the Programming language or a base of
        all kinds of programming languages.
        <br />
        It is strongly associated with UNIX as it was developed for the UNIX
        Operating system along with other databases and applications.
        <br />
        If you are fluent in C language you will never have a problem
        understanding other programming languages such as C++, JAVA, C#, and
        Python.
        <br />C is very old but very fast and versatile as it can be used in
        application development like device drivers, protocol stacks, and games
        as well. It has various versions also like C89/C90, C99, C11, and C18.
        ANSI C and ISO C were the standardized version released around 1989, and
        1990.
