      <h3>Introduction</h3>
      <p>
        The discipline of computer programming has changed significantly in the
        last few years. In the past, coding entailed telling computers how to
        complete tasksâ€”a procedure known as "hard coding." But this method takes
        a long time, requires a lot of work, and can't handle complicated tasks
        well, especially when dealing with unstructured input like text, audio,
        and photos. A revolutionary paradigm change in addressing these
        limitations has been the emergence of machine learning. Computers may
        learn from data without explicit programming thanks to machine learning
        algorithms, which give them the ability to forecast outcomes, identify
        trends, and come to their conclusions. Even though machine learning has
        transformed many fields, handling unstructured data types including
        text, speech, and photos continues to present difficulties. This is the
        application of deep learning. A subset of machine learning methods known
        as "deep learning" uses multi-layered artificial neural networks to
        automatically learn hierarchical data representations. Deep learning
        models may extract complex characteristics and patterns from raw data by
        iteratively processing it through various layers. This makes them ideal
        for handling unstructured data types such as image segmentation, speech
        recognition, natural language processing, and more. In several
        industries, including computer vision, speech recognition, autonomous
        vehicles, healthcare, and finance, deep learning has shown impressive
        promise. Its capacity to solve intricate issues and extract knowledge
        from massive volumes of unstructured data has elevated it to the
        forefront of artificial intelligence study and implementation.
