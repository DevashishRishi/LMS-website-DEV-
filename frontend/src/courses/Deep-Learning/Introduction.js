                <p>
                The discipline of computer programming has changed significantly in the last few years. In the past, coding entailed telling computers how to complete tasks—a procedure known as "hard coding." But this method takes a long time, requires a lot of work, and can't handle complicated tasks well, especially when dealing with unstructured input like text, audio, and photos.
                </p>
                <p>
                A revolutionary paradigm change in addressing these limitations has been the emergence of machine learning. Computers may learn from data without explicit programming thanks to machine learning algorithms, which give them the ability to forecast outcomes, identify trends, and come to their conclusions. Even though machine learning has transformed many fields, handling unstructured data types including text, speech, and photos continues to present difficulties.
                </p>
                <p>
                This is the application of deep learning. A subset of machine learning methods known as "deep learning" uses multi-layered artificial neural networks to automatically learn hierarchical data representations. Deep learning models may extract complex characteristics and patterns from raw data by iteratively processing it through various layers. This makes them ideal for handling unstructured data types such as image segmentation, speech recognition, natural language processing, and more.
                </p>
                <p>
                In several industries, including computer vision, speech recognition, autonomous vehicles, healthcare, and finance, deep learning has shown impressive promise. Its capacity to solve intricate issues and extract knowledge from massive volumes of unstructured data has elevated it to the forefront of artificial intelligence study and implementation

                <p>
                    Artificial neural networks are trained to learn from vast amounts of data and make predictions or judgments without explicit programming using a process known as deep learning, which is a subset of machine learning. It takes inspiration from the way the human brain processes and transmits information through its network of linked neurons. These artificial neural networks, known as deep learning networks, are made up of many layers of connected nodes, or neurons, which enable them to recognize intricate patterns and relationships in data.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Deep learning's capacity to automatically find and extract hierarchical representations of data at various levels of abstraction is one of its primary characteristics. Because deep neural networks can learn complex properties from unprocessed input data thanks to their hierarchical representation, they are especially useful for applications like speech identification, image recognition, and natural language processing, among others.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Large volumes of labeled data are often used in deep learning algorithms' training phases, where the network iteratively modifies its parameters using a procedure known as backpropagation to decrease the discrepancy between expected and actual outputs. Deep learning models can continuously enhance their performance over time through this process of learning from data.
                </p>
                <p>
                Deep learning has made tremendous strides and has been adopted by several industries, including healthcare, finance, automotive, and entertainment, thanks to the development of specialized hardware like graphics processing units (GPUs), big data availability, and computational power advancements. Deep learning is a potent tool for addressing real-world issues and promoting innovation in artificial intelligence due to its capacity to take on challenging tasks and attain state-of-the-art performance in numerous fields.

                    Similar to neural networks, deep learning algorithms are inspired by the composition and operations of the human brain. Similar to how interconnected neurons process information in the human brain, deep learning neural networks are made up of multiple layers of artificial neurons that work together to learn and evaluate data in a digital environment.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Within these networks, software components called nodes—also referred to as artificial neurons—process data. These nodes process input data mathematically, mimicking the computational powers of the brain to help artificial neural networks solve complex issues.

                These are the main or common components of deep learning network :-
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <h5 className="subHead">Input Layer</h5>
                        <p>
                            The input layer of an artificial neural network is made up of several nodes that are in charge of receiving and processing input data. These nodes act as the neural network's entry points, with each node representing a distinct feature or attribute of the input data. These nodes work together to form the first computational stage of the network, which enables it to take in and start processing the input data.
                        </p>

                        <h5 className="subHead">Hidden layer</h5>
                        <p>
                            The input layer of a deep learning neural network is where data is first received and processed. It then moves through further layers, or hidden layers, to process the data. To analyze the data at different levels of abstraction and modify their behavior in response to input, these hidden layers are essential. Deep learning networks are capable of having hundreds of hidden layers, which enables them to examine an issue from several angles.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                         Take the problem of categorizing an unknown species from a picture as an example. The hidden layers of a deep neural network work like how an observer might identify familiar animals based on characteristics like size, number of legs, fur pattern, and eye shape. Every hidden layer analyzes different aspects of the animal picture to identify patterns and traits that correspond to particular animal groups.

                                    The animal may be connected to a wild cat species by the network if its eyes have a resemblance to those of a cat. 
                                </p>

                            A deep learning model's output layer is made up of the nodes that generate the final output data. The output layer of models that are meant to give binary "yes" or "no" responses usually has simply two nodes in it. On the other hand, the output layer of models that are expected to yield a wider variety of responses has more nodes to handle the many possible results. In essence, the number of unique categories or answers that the model is trained to predict is equal to the number of nodes in the output layer.

                            <b>Boltzmann machine :-</b> One kind of stochastic recurrent neural network that consists of interconnected nodes arranged into visible and hidden layers is called a Boltzmann machine. Bidirectional connections between nodes within and across layers define these networks. Stochastic binary neurons, a method used by Boltzmann machines, involve the probabilistic activation of individual nodes that are impacted by the states of nearby nodes. Boltzmann machines iteratively update each node's state using a procedure called Gibbs sampling, which is based on the probability distribution produced by the weights and biases in the network. These models have been used for a variety of tasks, including feature learning, dimensionality reduction, and associative memory. They are capable of discovering intricate patterns and connections within input data. However, other deep learning designs like convolutional neural networks and recurrent neural networks have largely replaced Boltzmann machines due to the computational complexity of training and the difficulties involved in learning long-range relationships.

                    A branch of machine learning known as "deep learning" uses multiple-layered artificial neural networks to extract complicated patterns and representations from data. Due to its ability to allow machines to interpret and evaluate large amounts of data on their own, it has completely changed several sectors, including computer vision, natural language processing, and speech recognition. Because deep learning models can automatically extract hierarchical features from raw data, they are highly effective at tasks like language translation, picture classification, and time series prediction. Examples of these models are convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs). Deep learning has several drawbacks despite its amazing powers, such as the requirement for substantial quantities of labeled data, processing resources, and issues with interpretability and fairness. However, deep learning is still driving revolutionary advances in artificial intelligence and influencing the direction of technology and society through continued research and innovation.
