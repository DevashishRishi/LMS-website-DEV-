                <p>
                    The Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) operates on a feed-forward basis, its neuron connectivity pattern inspired by the visual cortex. This deep learning architecture is prominently used in computer vision, an artificial intelligence field focused on interpreting visual data.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A CNN is a more advanced version of a conventional artificial neural network that is designed specifically to extract features from datasets that resemble grids. These networks, also referred to as covnets, share parameters between layers. The convolutional layer of a CNN extracts relevant characteristics from input images by applying filters to them. In order to lessen computing load, a pooling layer also downsamples the image; in the end, the fully connected layer provides the final predictions. Gradient descent and backpropagation are how the CNN model determines which filters work best.
                </p>
                <p>
                It also generally has three layers like Artificial Neural Networks with same name which are input layer, hidden layer and output layer.

                    <b>Input layer :-</b> As the name implies, this layer receives input from the real world. Its neuron count aligns with the total number of features within the data (in image scenarios, this equates to the number of pixels).
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Hidden layer :-</b> Data moves on to the hidden layers after the input layer. The model and dataset size determine whether these layers are present and how many there are. The number of neurons in each hidden layer can vary, frequently exceeding the number of input features. Using learnable weights and biases, the output of each layer is calculated by multiplying its output by the matrix of the output of the layer before it. An activation function is applied to this outcome, adding non-linearity to the network.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Output layer :-</b> Data processed through the hidden layers is then directed to a logistic function like sigmoid or softmax. These functions transform each class's output into probability scores for each class.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The outcome generated from this process is termed "feedforward." Subsequently, an error calculation takes place using an error function, such as cross-entropy or square loss error. These functions measure the network's performance or the magnitude of error. Following this, derivatives are computed in a step called backpropagation, primarily aimed at minimizing the loss.

                <p>
                    Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) share parameters across layers. Consider an image, which can be visualized as a cuboid with length and width representing the image's dimensions and height depicting the channels (e.g., red, green, and blue channels in typical images). 
                </p>
                <div className="figure-container">
                        <img src={Figure3} alt="" />
                </div>
                <br/>
                <p>
                    Consider a scenario where we extract a small segment from an image and apply a neural network, referred to as a filter or kernel, to this segment, generating, for instance, K outputs arranged vertically. Extending this process across the entire image involves sliding this neural network across the image. Consequently, we obtain a modified image, differing in width, height, and depth. Unlike the traditional red, green, and blue channels (RGB), this image now possesses additional channels but reduced width and height. This process is known as Convolution. When the patch size aligns with the image size, it essentially operates as a conventional neural network. This use of smaller patches significantly reduces the number of weights involved.
                </p>

                <p> Letâ€™s look at the mathematics that is involve in this whole convolution process.</p>

                        <p>
                            Convolution layers consist of learnable filters, also known as kernels. These filters possess small widths and heights, matching the depth of the input volume (typically 3 for image inputs).
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Suppose we have an image for convolution with dimensions 34x34x3. The size of the filter can be axax3, where 'a' can vary, such as 3, 5, or 7, but it must be smaller than the image's dimensions.
                        </p>

                    <li>
                        <p>
                            During the forward pass, each filter traverses the entire input volume, moving step by step. This step is referred to as the stride, which may have values like 2, 3, or 4 for high-dimensional images. For each step, the network computes the dot product between the kernel weights and the patch from the input volume.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            As the filters slide, a 2-D output is obtained for each filter. These outputs are then stacked together, resulting in an output volume with a depth equivalent to the number of filters. Through this process, the network learns and adapts its filters..

                <p>
                    A convolutional neural network (CNN) comprises different layers, each transforming one volume into another using a differentiable function. Here's an overview using an example image of dimensions 32 x 32 x 3.

                <p>
                    <b>Input Layer :-</b> This layer receives input from the external world, commonly images or image sequences in CNNs. It holds the original image data with a width of 32, height of 32, and depth of 3.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <b>Convolutional Layers :-</b> Here, the input dataset undergoes feature extraction. Kernels or learnable filters, typically 2x2, 3x3, or 5x5 matrices, are applied to the input images. These filters slide over the input data, performing dot products with corresponding patches. The resulting output is termed feature maps. For instance, if there are 12 filters in this layer, the output volume becomes 32x32x12.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <b>Activation Layer :-</b> Adding nonlinearity to the network, this layer applies an element-wise activation function to the convolutional layer output. Common activation functions include ReLU (max(0, x)), Tanh, Leaky ReLU, etc. This layer maintains the output volume dimensions as 32 x 32 x 12.

                <p>
                    <b>Pooling Layer :-</b> Periodically integrated into the CNN, this layer aims to reduce data volume size for faster computation, less memory usage, and overfitting prevention. Common types are max pooling and average pooling. For instance, using 2x2 filters and a stride of 2 in max pooling would yield an output volume of 16x16x12.

                </p>

                <p>
                    <b>Fully Connected Layers :-</b> Positioned just before the output layer, this layer receives input from its preceding layer and computes the final classification or regression task.

                    <b>Output Layer :-</b> The fully connected layers' output is then input into a logistic function, which effectively converts the output of each class into the corresponding probability score that it falls below or falls within for classification tasks like sigmoid or softmax.

                    Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) serve as the backbone of modern computer vision, exhibiting a sophisticated architecture designed for extracting intricate patterns from visual data. Their foundational components, like convolutional and pooling layers, facilitate the extraction of hierarchical features. The convolutional layers apply filters across input images, detecting diverse visual characteristics like edges and textures. Subsequently, pooling layers condense these features, preserving essential information while decreasing computational complexity. These networks harness hierarchical learning, progressing through layers to discern increasingly complex patterns by combining lower-level features. The integration of non-linear activation functions, such as Rectified Linear Units (ReLU), introduces flexibility and sophistication into the networkâ€™s learning process, enabling it to model complex relationships within images.

                    The prowess of CNNs extends across a spectrum of image-related tasks, from image classification and object detection to semantic segmentation. Despite their remarkable performance, CNNs demand substantial computational resources and extensive labeled datasets for training. Moreover, interpreting, CNNs stand as a pillar in reshaping machine understanding of visual information, propelling advancements in artificial intelligence and bolstering applications in diverse domain, from healthcare and autonomous vehicles to robotics and beyond.
